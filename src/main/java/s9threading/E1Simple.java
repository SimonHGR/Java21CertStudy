/*
Key differences between Platform and Virtual threads:
- class is not-public, so cannot use new to construct
-- use factory or builder -- builder allows easy change of type
-- can also use AutoCloseable Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()
- virtual priority is fixed at 5 / normal
- virtual is always daemon -- attempt to set non-daemon throws exception
-- usually need to find a way to determine a task is completed
- scheduling / management of virtual is handled by JVM, not by OS
-- facilitates much higher numbers of threads (avoids numerical and
   architectural/memory limits of OS)
-- virtual does NOT increase total CPU power available--if vast numbers
   of threads are blocked most of the time, that's fine, but if they're
   trying to run, the system will bog down
